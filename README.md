# iParking Data Fetcher

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts that retrieve parking data from the iParking system at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The data is fetched via HTTP POST requests to the iParking API and saved into CSV files for analysis or archival purposes.

## Scripts

### 1. Daily Parking History Script (`parking_history_data.csv`)
- Retrieves parking data for specific parking lots (IDs: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7) showing available spaces throughout the day.
- The data is stored in a CSV file, with columns for parking lot names and rows for time points.

### 2. Current Parking Status Script (`parking_data.csv`)
- Sends a request to the iParking API to get the current availability of all parking lots.
- The data is written to a CSV file, with columns for the timestamp and the number of available spaces per parking lot.
